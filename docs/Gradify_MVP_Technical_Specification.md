# 4. MVP Architecture

## 4.1 Architectural Style

The Gradify MVP follows a **microservices-inspired modular architecture**, leveraging the **Layered (n-tier)** style for internal services.  
This ensures:

- Clear separation of concerns (presentation, business logic, data access).  
- Scalable, maintainable codebases for each module (auth, certificates, scholarships, etc.).  
- Independent deployment and development of services if needed in the future.

For critical integrations with the blockchain (on-chain) and database (off-chain), Gradify uses **API-driven communication**.

---

## 4.2 Architectural Pattern

The chosen architectural pattern is **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**.  
This pattern ensures that:

- Core business logic (domain layer) is **isolated** from infrastructure and external dependencies (blockchain, DB, etc.).  
- Ports (interfaces) define how the system communicates internally and externally.  
- Adapters implement these ports for specific technologies (Stellar, PostgreSQL, etc.).

---

## 4.3 Design Patterns

To promote scalability, testability, and maintainability, Gradify will employ key design patterns:

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data persistence logic, decoupling the domain from the database.  
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating domain objects like Certificates and Scholarships consistently.  
- **Observer/Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: For event-driven flows (e.g., real-time notifications, blockchain confirmations).  
- **Adapter Pattern**: To integrate blockchain (Soroban) and file storage (IPFS or Cloud) without coupling.  
- **Strategy Pattern**: For authentication flows (social login, wallet-based login, email/password).

# 5. Component-Level Architecture

This section provides detailed component-level descriptions for the key modules of the Gradify MVP.  
These components illustrate how we will organize business logic, persistence, blockchain interactions, and external integrations.

---

## 5.1 Certificate Module

The Certificate Module manages the issuance, storage, and verification of academic certificates. It is designed to integrate off-chain data (PostgreSQL, file storage) with on-chain data (Stellar blockchain and smart contracts).

**Components:**

- **CertificateController**: Handles API endpoints for issuing and viewing certificates.
- **CertificateService**: Contains business logic for certificate issuance, metadata handling, and blockchain interactions.
- **CertificateRepository**: Manages persistence of certificate data in PostgreSQL.
- **BlockchainAdapter**: Acts as an adapter to interact with Stellar/Soroban smart contracts, ensuring proper blockchain operations.
- **QRCodeGenerator**: Generates QR codes for certificate verification by third-party verifiers.

**External Integrations:**

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores certificate metadata (titles, descriptions, status, etc.).
- **IPFS / Cloud Storage**: Stores the actual certificate files, with hashes stored on the blockchain.
- **Stellar Blockchain**: Records the certificateâ€™s hash and metadata immutably, ensuring authenticity and verification.

---

## 5.2 Scholarship Module

The Scholarship Module manages scholarships, applications, and the on-chain disbursement of scholarship funds through smart contracts.

**Components:**

- **ScholarshipController**: Provides API endpoints for creating scholarships, managing them, and viewing applications.
- **ScholarshipService**: Business logic for eligibility checks, application handling, and interactions with smart contracts for scholarship disbursement.
- **ScholarshipRepository**: Manages storage and retrieval of scholarship and application data.
- **BlockchainAdapter**: Connects to Stellar/Soroban smart contracts to handle automated fund disbursement and track on-chain transactions.
- **NotificationService**: Sends updates to users about their application status, scholarship awards, and blockchain activity.

**External Integrations:**

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores scholarships, applications, donor data, and associated metadata.
- **Stellar Blockchain**: Automates scholarship fund disbursement via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and immutability.

---

# 6. Smart Contract Interactions (Stellar/Soroban)

This section describes the transaction flows and smart contract interactions for the Gradify MVP.  
We define how critical data (certificates, scholarships, donations) are handled on-chain for immutability, transparency, and automation.

---

## 6.1 High-Level Overview

Gradify uses **Stellar blockchain** and **Soroban smart contracts** for the following purposes:

- **Immutable Academic Credentials**: Certificates are registered on-chain as NFTs or immutable transactions.
- **Automated Scholarship Disbursement**: Smart contracts manage the secure and transparent release of scholarship funds.
- **Donation Tracking and Impact**: Donorsâ€™ contributions are handled through blockchain transactions for auditability.

---

## 6.2 Certificate Issuance Flow (On-Chain)

**1. Certificate Creation**  
- The institution creates the certificate in the backend (off-chain): includes details like title, description, student, and associated file (IPFS or cloud bucket).  
- The fileâ€™s hash is generated and linked to the certificate metadata.

**2. Blockchain Registration**  
- The backend (CertificateService) invokes the **BlockchainAdapter** to interact with Soroban smart contracts.  
- A smart contract function is called to register the certificateâ€™s hash and metadata as an NFT or immutable record on the Stellar blockchain.  
- The blockchain transaction hash is stored in PostgreSQL for verification.

**3. Verification**  
- Verifiers or third parties use the public verification page (QR code) to retrieve the transaction hash and validate certificate authenticity on-chain.

---

## 6.3 Scholarship Disbursement Flow (On-Chain)

**1. Scholarship Creation**  
- Institutions create scholarships (off-chain data stored in PostgreSQL).  
- A corresponding smart contract is deployed (or updated) on Soroban to manage disbursement rules.

**2. Student Application**  
- Students apply for scholarships via the frontend (off-chain).  
- Applications are reviewed and approved by the institution.

**3. Fund Disbursement**  
- Once approved, the backend (ScholarshipService) triggers a smart contract call through the BlockchainAdapter.  
- The smart contract verifies eligibility criteria and releases funds directly to the studentâ€™s wallet (on Stellar blockchain).

**4. Donor Interaction**  
- Donors contribute to scholarships via on-chain transactions.  
- Smart contracts track donor contributions and update balances in real-time.

**5. Blockchain Transparency**  
- All scholarship-related transactions (creation, donor funding, disbursement) are recorded immutably on the Stellar blockchain for transparency and auditability.
