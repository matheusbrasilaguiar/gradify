## Vision

**Gradify** is revolutionizing how academic certificates are issued and scholarships are funded — using blockchain to ensure authenticity, automate scholarship allocation, and build global trust in education.

We connect educational institutions, students, and donors in a secure, decentralized ecosystem that democratizes access to education worldwide.

---

## Why Gradify?

- **Diploma fraud** is a billion-dollar global issue that undermines the credibility of education.
- **Scholarship funds** are often lost to bureaucracy, opacity, and inefficiency.
- **Academic credentials** are not easily portable or verifiable across borders.
- Gradify leverages **Web3/blockchain** to create a global, immutable academic and scholarship infrastructure.

---

## What We Offer

- **Decentralized academic certificate issuance & verification**  
  Institutions can issue blockchain-registered certificates (NFTs/records) verifiable by third parties worldwide.

- **Smart contract-powered, transparent scholarships**  
  Donors fund scholarships, and smart contracts automate disbursement directly to eligible students, with all transactions recorded on-chain.

- **Role-based dashboards**  
  Dedicated experiences for Students, Institutions, and Donors.

- **GDPR/LGPD compliance**  
  Privacy and security for all users.

- **Modular, scalable architecture**  
  Designed for growth, portability, and interoperability.

---

## How It Works

1. **Institutions** issue verifiable certificates and create scholarships.  
2. **Students** enroll, access available scholarships, and apply seamlessly.  
3. **Donors** fund scholarships through secure blockchain transactions.  
4. **Smart contracts** automatically disburse funds to eligible students, ensuring full transparency.
